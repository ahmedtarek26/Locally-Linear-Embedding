# Swiss Roll Dataset - Complete Information

## Overview

The Swiss Roll is a classic 2D manifold embedded in 3D space, used extensively for benchmarking manifold learning algorithms.

## Mathematical Definition

The Swiss Roll is generated by sampling points from a 2D rectangular region and mapping them to 3D:

```
t ~ Uniform[t_min, t_max]
h ~ Uniform[h_min, h_max]

x = t * cos(t)
y = h
z = t * sin(t)
```

With optional Gaussian noise added to each coordinate.

## Our Dataset Specifications

### Parameters Used
- **n_samples**: 2,000 points
- **noise**: 0.1 (small Gaussian noise)
- **random_state**: 42 (for reproducibility)
- **Implementation**: `sklearn.datasets.make_swiss_roll`

### Dataset Characteristics

**Shape:**
- Input: (2000, 3) - 2000 points in 3D space
- Intrinsic dimension: 2D (it's a rolled 2D surface)

**Data Ranges (before standardization):**
- X coordinate: [-9.71, 12.84]
- Y coordinate: [-0.10, 21.06]  
- Z coordinate: [-11.25, 14.23]

**Color Array:**
- Shape: (2000,)
- Range: [4.74, 14.13]
- Represents position along the unrolled manifold
- Used only for visualization/validation, not for algorithms

### Preprocessing

Standard preprocessing applied:
1. **Standardization**: Zero mean, unit variance per feature
2. **No rotation or other transforms**: Preserves manifold structure

## Why Swiss Roll?

### Historical Context

The Swiss Roll was popularized by:
1. **Tenenbaum et al. (2000)** in the Isomap paper
2. **Roweis & Saul (2000)** in the LLE paper

It became a standard benchmark for manifold learning algorithms.

### What It Tests

**Geometric Challenge:**
- Points that are close on the 2D surface may be far in 3D Euclidean space
- Points across different "layers" of the roll are nearby in 3D but far on the manifold
- Tests ability to respect intrinsic (manifold) geometry, not extrinsic (embedding) geometry

**Algorithm Performance:**
- **Linear methods (PCA, MDS)**: Fail - cannot unroll the manifold
- **Manifold methods (LLE, Isomap, UMAP)**: Succeed - preserve local/global structure
- **t-SNE**: Succeeds but focuses on local structure

### Visualization Analogy

Think of it like a **jelly roll cake** or **rolled paper**:
- The flat sheet is the intrinsic 2D manifold
- Rolling it creates the 3D embedding
- "Unrolling" is what good manifold learning algorithms do

## File Contents

### Saved Files

```
data/swiss_roll_data.npy          # Original 3D coordinates (2000, 3)
data/swiss_roll_color.npy         # Ground truth positions (2000,)
data/swiss_roll_scaled.npy        # Standardized data (2000, 3)
```

### Loading the Data

```python
import numpy as np

# Load original data
X = np.load('data/swiss_roll_data.npy')
color = np.load('data/swiss_roll_color.npy')

# Load preprocessed data
X_scaled = np.load('data/swiss_roll_scaled.npy')

print(f"Data shape: {X.shape}")
print(f"Color shape: {color.shape}")
```

## Expected Results

### Good Embeddings

A good 2D embedding should:
1. **Unroll** the manifold - flatten the roll
2. **Preserve distances** along the surface
3. **Show clear structure** - ordered arrangement matching color

### Method Expectations

| Method | Expected Performance |
|--------|---------------------|
| PCA | Poor - projects but doesn't unroll |
| MDS | Poor - preserves 3D distances, not manifold distances |
| Isomap | Excellent - uses geodesic distances |
| LLE | Excellent - preserves local linear structure |
| Kernel PCA | Moderate - depends on kernel |
| t-SNE | Excellent for visualization - preserves neighbors |
| UMAP | Excellent - balances local and global |

## Comparison with LLE Paper

### Paper Dataset (Figure 1)

Roweis & Saul (2000) used:
- N = 2,000 points (same as ours)
- K = 20 neighbors (we use K = 12)
- Same manifold type
- Used for Figure 1 in the paper

### Our Choice of Parameters

We use **K = 12** for LLE because:
- Same as used for faces in the paper
- Good balance between local and global structure
- Computationally efficient
- Standard choice in literature

## Alternative Datasets

Other manifolds we could test:

### S-Curve
```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_s_curve
X, color = make_s_curve(n_samples=2000, noise=0.1)
```
- Also 2D manifold in 3D
- "S" shaped surface
- Tests similar properties

### MNIST Digits
```python
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
mnist = fetch_openml('mnist_784')
```
- High-dimensional (784D)
- Real data, not synthetic
- Much more complex manifold
